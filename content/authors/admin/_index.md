I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Ã‰va Tardos](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/) and [Prof. Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/). My interests are broadly in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and networks. Currently, I'm working on generalizing submodularity to ordered sequences and lists, with applications in diversification of recommender systems. 

Previously, I graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in Chemistry and minors in Applied Math and Computer Science, where I worked with [Prof. Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) on Bayesian auction design for multi-item revenue maximization. I also wrote my senior thesis in physical organic chemistry under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Knowles](https://knowleslab.princeton.edu/).

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Mortality-trends from alcoholic liver disease (ALD)
              have recently increased and they differ by various factors in the
              U.S. However, these trends have only been analyzed using
              univariate models and in reality they may be influenced by
              various factors. We thus examined trends in age-standardized
              mortality from ALD among U.S. adults for 1999-2017, using
              multivariable piecewise log-linear models. METHODS: We collected
              mortality-data from the Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research
              database, using the Underlying Cause of Death. RESULTS: We
              identified 296,194 deaths from ALD and 346,386 deaths indirectly
              attributable to ALD during the period from 1999-2017. The
              multivariable-adjusted, age-standardized ALD mortality was stable
              during 1999-2006 (annual percentage change [APC]=-2.24, P=0.24),
              and increased during 2006-2017 (APC=3.18, P<0.006). Their trends
              did not differ by sex, race, age or urbanization. Subgroup
              analyses revealed upward multivariable-adjusted, age-standardized
              mortality-trends in alcoholic fatty liver (APC=4.64, P<0.001),
              alcoholic hepatitis (APC=4.38, P<0.001), and alcoholic cirrhosis
              (APC=5.33, P<0.001), but downward mortality-trends in alcoholic
              hepatic failure (APC=-1.63, P=0.006) and unspecified ALD
              (APC=-0.86, P=0.013). Strikingly, non-alcoholic cirrhosis also
              had an upward multivariable-adjusted, age-standardized
              mortality-trend (APC=0.69, P=0.046). By contrast, recent
              mortality-trends were stable for all cause of deaths (APC=-0.39,
              P=0.379) and downward for malignant neoplasms excluding liver
              cancer (APC=-2.82, P<0.001), infections (APC=-2.60, P<0.001),
              cardiovascular disease (APC=-0.69, P=0.044) and respiratory
              disease (APC=-0.56, P=0.002). The adjusted mortality with ALD as
              a contributing cause of death also had an upward trend during
              2000-2017 (APC=5.47, P<0.001). Strikingly, common comorbidities
              of ALD, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cerebrovascular and
              ischemic heart cardiovascular diseases and sepsis, had upward
              trends during the past 14 to 16 years. CONCLUSIONS: ALD had an
              upward multivariable-adjusted, age-standardized mortality-trend
              among U.S. adults, without significant differences by sex, race,
              age or urbanization. Three ALD subtypes (alcoholic fatty liver,
              alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis) and non-alcoholic
              cirrhosis had upward morality-trends, while other ALD subtypes
              and other causes of death did not.",
